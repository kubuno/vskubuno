## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial VSIX skeleton for "Kubuno for Visual Studio": classic VSSDK `AsyncPackage`, .NET
  Framework 4.8, targeting Visual Studio 17.x/18.x (Community/Professional/Enterprise, amd64;
  arm64 declared but unverified).
- `ILanguageClient` for the `rust` content type: launches rust-analyzer over stdio for `.rs`
  files. rust-analyzer is located via, in order: a Tools > Options > Kubuno > Rust path override,
  `rustup which rust-analyzer`, `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin\rust-analyzer.exe`, then PATH. An info
  bar with the exact fix (`rustup component add rust-analyzer`) is shown when it cannot be found.
- The Cargo workspace root passed to rust-analyzer is the folder containing the nearest
  `Cargo.toml` above the active document, or the Open Folder workspace root as a fallback
  (`Kubuno.VisualStudio.Core.CargoWorkspaceLocator`).
- A "Kubuno" pane in the Output window logs rust-analyzer discovery decisions, start/stop, and
  errors; raw LSP traffic can optionally be added via the new "LSP trace" option (Off by default).
- TextMate grammar for Rust (vendored from Visual Studio Code's built-in Rust extension, MIT
  licensed) shipped in the VSIX and registered via `languages.pkgdef`, so `.rs` files are
  colorized even before rust-analyzer starts.
- "Format Document" works through LSP formatting (rust-analyzer delegates to rustfmt); an
  optional "Format on save" setting (off by default) runs it automatically before a `.rs` file is
  saved.
- Tools > Options > Kubuno > Rust page: rust-analyzer path override, format on save, LSP trace
  level.
- `Kubuno.VisualStudio.Core`: rust-analyzer/Cargo-workspace discovery logic with no VS SDK
  dependency, covered by unit tests (`tests/Kubuno.VisualStudio.Tests`, runnable with
  `dotnet test`).
- `samples/hello-rust`: a minimal Cargo project (bin + lib + example + test) used to manually
  verify the extension in an experimental Visual Studio instance.
